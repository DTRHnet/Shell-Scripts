Pattern Name: explain_terms
Summary: Produces a glossary of important terms from the input content, giving a two-sentence explanation for each term ￼.
Example Use [prompt]: echo "Quantum Computing is mentioned alongside qubits and superposition." | fabric -p explain_terms
Example Response:

	Glossary:
Quantum Computing: A computing paradigm using quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations. It exploits qubits (quantum bits) which, unlike binary bits, can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling exponential processing power for certain tasks.
Qubit: The fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of states. This property allows quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities at once, vastly increasing computational potential for specific algorithms.
Superposition: A principle of quantum theory where a quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time until measured. In computing, superposition allows qubits to perform many calculations simultaneously, forming the basis of quantum computing’s potential power.

Pattern Name: explain_code
Summary: Takes source code (and documentation) as input and provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of what the code does ￼.
Example Use [prompt]: echo "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b" | fabric -p explain_code
Example Response:

	Code Explanation: This Python function is named add and accepts two parameters, a and b. It returns the sum of a and b. In other words, if you call add(5, 3), it will compute 5 + 3 and give the result 8. This function provides a simple addition operation for two numbers.

Pattern Name: extract_wisdom
